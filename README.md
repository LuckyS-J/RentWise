### Notes

- Ownership is enforced server-side: users can only access and modify their own properties, leases, and payments.
- Lease contract PDFs are generated on demand and accessible only by the tenant or property owner.

   ```

5. **Shut down containers**  
    ```bash
   docker-compose down
    ```

6. **Run tests**  
    ```bash
   docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py test
    ```

7. **Start Docker containers and run them**
